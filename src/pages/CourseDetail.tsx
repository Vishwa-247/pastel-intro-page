# React Component Patterns

React offers various component patterns that help in creating reusable, maintainable, and optimized code. Here are the main patterns you should know:

## 1. Compound Components

Compound components are a pattern where components are composed together to share an implicit state while giving the user complete control over the rendering and composition of the components.

\`\`\`jsx
// Usage example
<Menu>
  <MenuButton>Options</MenuButton>
  <MenuList>
    <MenuItem>Download</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Create a Copy</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Delete</MenuItem>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
\`\`\`

## 2. Render Props

Render Props is a technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function.

\`\`\`jsx
// Example
<DataProvider render={data => (
  <h1>Hello {data.target}</h1>
)}/>
\`\`\`

## 3. Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior.

\`\`\`jsx
// Example
const EnhancedComponent = withExtraProps(BaseComponent);
\`\`\`

## 4. Custom Hooks

Custom Hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions.

\`\`\`jsx
// Example
function useFormInput(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
  
  function handleChange(e) {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  }
  
  return {
    value,
    onChange: handleChange
  };
}
\`\`\`

## 5. Control Props

Control Props give the parent component control over the internal state of a child component.

\`\`\`jsx
// Example
<Dropdown
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onToggle={setIsOpen}
  items={items}
/>
\`\`\`

Each pattern has its own use cases and trade-offs. Understanding when to use each pattern will help you design more flexible and maintainable React applications.

      title: "Advanced State Management",
      content: `
# Advanced State Management in React

State management is one of the most critical aspects of building complex React applications. This chapter covers advanced state management techniques beyond simple useState.

## 1. Context API for Global State

React's Context API provides a way to share values like themes or user data without having to explicitly pass props through every level of the component tree.

\`\`\`jsx
// Creating a context
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

// Provider component
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <ThemedButton />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Consumer component
function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <Button theme={theme} />;
}
\`\`\`

## 2. Redux and Redux Toolkit

Redux provides a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development.

\`\`\`jsx
// Redux slice with Redux Toolkit
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    incremented: state => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decremented: state => {
      state.value -= 1;
    }
  }
});
\`\`\`

## 3. Zustand

Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state-management solution using simplified flux principles.

\`\`\`jsx
// Creating a store
const useStore = create(set => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set(state => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 })
}));
\`\`\`

## 4. React Query for Server State

React Query is a library for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React.

\`\`\`jsx
// Example usage
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery('todos', fetchTodos);
\`\`\`

## 5. Recoil

Recoil is an experimental state management library for React apps developed by Facebook.

\`\`\`jsx
// Defining an atom
const counterState = atom({
  key: 'counterState',
  default: 0,
});

// Using the atom
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useRecoilState(counterState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
}
\`\`\`

Understanding these state management techniques will help you choose the right solution for your specific use case, from simple component state to complex global state management.

      title: "Performance Optimization Techniques",
      content: `
# Performance Optimization Techniques in React

Optimizing React applications is crucial for providing a smooth user experience. This chapter covers various techniques to improve the performance of your React applications.

## 1. Memoization with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback

These React features help prevent unnecessary re-renders and recalculations.

\`\`\`jsx
// React.memo example
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // Only re-renders if props change
  return <div>{props.name}</div>;
});

// useMemo example
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

// useCallback example
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
\`\`\`

## 2. Code Splitting with React.lazy and Suspense

Code splitting allows you to split your code into small chunks that can be loaded on demand.

\`\`\`jsx
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <OtherComponent />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## 3. Virtualization for Long Lists

Virtualization renders only the visible items in a long list, significantly improving performance.

\`\`\`jsx
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';

function VirtualizedList({ items }) {
  const Row = ({ index, style }) => (
    <div style={style}>
      {items[index]}
    </div>
  );

  return (
    <FixedSizeList
      height={500}
      width={300}
      itemCount={items.length}
      itemSize={35}
    >
      {Row}
    </FixedSizeList>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## 4. Web Workers for CPU-Intensive Tasks

Web Workers allow you to run JavaScript in background threads, keeping the UI responsive.

\`\`\`jsx
// Creating a worker
const worker = new Worker('./worker.js');

// Sending message to worker
worker.postMessage({ data: complexData });

// Receiving results from worker
worker.onmessage = function(e) {
  const result = e.data;
  setProcessedData(result);
};
\`\`\`

## 5. Bundle Size Optimization

Reducing bundle size improves loading times and overall performance.

- Use lightweight alternatives (e.g., Preact instead of React for simple apps)
- Tree shaking to eliminate dead code
- Dynamic imports for less frequently used features
- Analyze bundle with tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer

\`\`\`jsx
// Dynamic import example
const loadAnalytics = () => import('./analytics');

button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const analytics = await loadAnalytics();
  analytics.trackClick();
});
\`\`\`

Implementing these optimization techniques will help you build React applications that are fast, responsive, and provide a great user experience even as the application grows in complexity.
